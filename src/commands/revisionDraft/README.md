When comparing items for changes in single revision mode, prefer referencing the `containerApp` template.  When comparing items in multiple revisions mode, prefer referencing the `revision` template.

Reason:  Even though the `containerApp` template is essentially equivalent to the `latest` revision template... sometimes there are micro-differences present.  Although they end up being functionally equivalent, they may not always be equivalent enough to consistently pass a deep copy test (which is how we are set up to detect unsaved changes).
